# coffeemap

# Tech Stack
  - Postges (with prisma.io)
  - Express
  - React
  - Node

Note: For this deployment, we are using Heroku Postgres.

# Objective:

- List down the coffee spots and find the nearest place to visit
- Record the coffee taste profile and the coffee origin (blend or a single origin coffee)
- Records may be bookmarked in IG or otherwise saved in google map.
- Do not need to search social media or save in google map (toggle around 2 apps)

My personal problem faced: records in many different platforms, consolidate all into one app.

# CRUD

- Create User
- Create Cafe (with authentication)
- Create Reviews (with authentication)

- Read User, Cafe, Reviews

- Update User

- Delete user and records (with authentication)

# Google React Map
Display a list of cafes and pinned location on Google Map
